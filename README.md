# H-He EOS quantities for planetary evolution [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/639560032.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10659248)

This repository contains H-He EOSes from [Saumon et al. (1995; SCvH)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJS...99..713S/abstract), [Militzer & Hubbard (2013; MH13)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/774/2/148/meta), [Chabrier et al. (2019; CMS19)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf99f/meta), [Chabrier & Debras (2021; CD21)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfc48/meta), and [Mazevet et al. (2022; MLS22)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/08/aa35764-19/aa35764-19.html). The CMS and MLS EOSes are supplemented by the work of [Howard et al. (2023a)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2023/04/aa44851-22.pdf) to account for the non-ideal entropy and volume interactions they calculated from MH13 and CD21. Moreover, we calculate H-He-Z mixutures using a water EOS from [Haldemann et al. (2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/11/aa38367-20/aa38367-20.html), iron, and post-perovskite EOSes from Jisheng Zhang (private communication). 

To ease thermodynamic derivative calculations, we have inverted the H-He EOSes to provide several independent axes:

and thus Github's Large File Storage is required. 

To download and use these tables, 

1. ```git lfs install```
2. ```git clone https://github.com/Rob685/eos.git```

Please see the tutorials in this repo for instructions.
