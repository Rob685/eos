This repository contains H-He EOSes from [Saumon et al. (1995)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJS...99..713S/abstract), [Militzer & Hubbard (2013)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/774/2/148/meta), [Chabrier et al. (2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf99f/meta), [Chabrier & Debras (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfc48/meta), and [Mazevet et al. (2022)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/08/aa35764-19/aa35764-19.html), a water EOS from [Haldemann et al. (2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/11/aa38367-20/aa38367-20.html), iron, and post-perovskite EOSes from Jisheng Zhang (private communication). 

To ease thermodynamic derivative calculations, we have inverted the H-He EOSes to provide several independent axes:
