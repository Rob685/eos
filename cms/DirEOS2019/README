>>> UPDATE June 2021: includes the tables for Y=0.292 (values used for BD models in Phillips et al. 2020) <<<

"A new equation of state for dense hydrogen-helium mixtures"
Chabrier, Mazevet & Soubiran, 2019, ApJ, 872, 51
-----------------------------------------------------------

Equation of state tables for pure H, pure He and
2 helium mass fractions: Y=0.275 (Z=0) and Y=Y_eff=0.292 (Z=0.017). 
For this EOS, all extensive quantities are calculated within the Additive Volume Law
approximation (see publication)

- The (log T, log P) tables include NT=121 isotherms
between logT=2.0 and logT=8.0 with a step dlogT=0.05.
Each isotherm includes NP=441 pressures from
logP=-9.0 to log P=+13.0 with a step dlogP=0.05.
- The (log T, log rho) tables include NT=121 isotherms
between logT=2.0 and logT=8.0 with a step dlogT=0.05.
Each isotherm includes Nrho=281 densities from
log rho=-8.0 to log rho=+6.0 with a step dlog rho=0.05.

An example of the quantities listed in the tables is given
in Table 1 of the publication.
Units are:
 T[K], P[GPa=0.1 Mbar], rho [g/cm3], U[MJ/kg], S[MJ/kg/K]

                 *** Warning ! ***
For practical purposes, the tables are rectangular.
Therefore, values at very low densities (log rho < -8.0)
in the (log T, log P) table are unphysical.

Similarly, values in the solid phase or beyond the limit of
the first order quantum correction for the ions are unphysical
(see details and Figs. 1 and 16 in the publication).
                 *****************

A word of caution:
Due to the spline interpolation procedure, numerical
oscillations or flaws in the calculations of the various
thermodynamic quantities are expected. As these problems
will be revealed, the tables will be corrected
accordingly. For a clear identification of the most recent
version of the tables, these latter will be labeled with
a _vx extension, as a reference to "version x". The date
corresponding to this version will be given at the top of the present
README file.
